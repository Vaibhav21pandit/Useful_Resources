# Useful_Resources
All tutorials and tech talks that I found useful over the internet.
Note- Kaggle is generally perceived to be a place where ML competitions are held but I'd like for you to explore the the Learn Section of the website(You're not gonna be disappointed,Trust me on this),It has the best Hands-on tutorials ever.

MACHINE LEARNING-
1)Kaggle's hands-on Tutorials(https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning)
  this is the best tutorial on regressional predictions where you start learning from how to explore and analyze your data to   models like XGBoost to advanced conceps like data leakage.
2)MachineLearningMastery(https://machinelearningmastery.com/blog/)-Go see for youself
3)Sentdex's ML playlist-This is a friendly introduction to Machine Learning where you will go from 0 to 100 but you must have   a sound knowledge of numpy and pandas first.
4)This complete playlist(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj0neYUp9Tc&list=PL9ooVrP1hQOHUfd-g8GUpKI3hHOwM_9Dn) of youtube       videos from Edureka on Youtube




DEEP LEARNING-
1)Kaggle's hands on deep learning tutorial(https://www.kaggle.com/learn/deep-learning)
2)Goodfellow's Book on Deep Learning is stil the holy grail of all the material that's available on deep learning.Get it here on this Gihub repo(https://github.com/janishar/mit-deep-learning-book-pdf)

VISUALIZATION TOOLS-



NLP-
1)CS224n Winter 2017-Stanford Course taught by Chris Manning.Get all the solved assignments,Lecture notes and other stuff here(https://github.com/maxim5/cs224n-winter-2017)
2)Implementation of various tasks using NLTK- Sentdex's NLTK playlist
3)





COMPUTER VISION





CNNs





RNNs & LSTMs




ENSEMBLE MODELS-Even though I should have included this under the ML section itself, but ensemble models are not enough emphasised on by Blogs and books much.This is a great video from NPTEL(https://nptel.ac.in/courses/128106002/42)  
2)A beautiful kernel on stacked regressions on Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/serigne/stacked-regressions-top-4-on-leaderboard/data)









R Programming



SQL-I prefer the combination of W3school and SQLfiddle for concept building and practice but you can do both on Kaggle-Learn(If you're too lazy to switch back and forth between 2 tabs!) without any hesitation.



Dashboarding-Want to make cool dashboards to make your data visualisations better? head to Kaggle(Yes,Again!) and follow Rachael Tatman(https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/dashboarding-with-notebooks-day-1)



Apache Spark-



DATASETS-ohh yes there is no ML without Datasets.Here's a comprehensive list of sources to get s=datasets from-
1)Kaggle-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
2)MNIST Datasets
