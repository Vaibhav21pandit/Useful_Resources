# Useful_Resources
All tutorials and tech talks that I found useful over the internet. /n
Note- Kaggle is generally perceived to be a place where ML competitions are held but I'd like for you to explore the the Learn Section of the website(You're not gonna be disappointed,Trust me on this),It has the best Hands-on tutorials ever.

MACHINE LEARNING-
1)Kaggle's hands-on Tutorials(https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning)
  this is the best tutorial on regressional predictions where you start learning from how to explore and analyze your data to   models like XGBoost to advanced conceps like data leakage.
2)MachineLearningMastery(https://machinelearningmastery.com/blog/)-Go see for youself
3)Sentdex's ML playlist-This is a friendly introduction to Machine Learning where you will go from 0 to 100 but you must have   a sound knowledge of numpy and pandas first.
4)This complete playlist(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj0neYUp9Tc&list=PL9ooVrP1hQOHUfd-g8GUpKI3hHOwM_9Dn) of youtube       videos from Edureka on Youtube




DEEP LEARNING-
1)Kaggle's hands on deep learning tutorial(https://www.kaggle.com/learn/deep-learning)
2)Goodfellow's Book on Deep Learning is stil the holy grail of all the material that's available on deep learning.Get it here on this Gihub repo(https://github.com/janishar/mit-deep-learning-book-pdf)
3)The most intuitive and visual-rich tutorial on Artificial Neural Networks on youtube where amost all the concepts are visually explained(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
4)Want to deconstruct ans see what goes on inside Google's most famous and astonishingly easy-to-use deep learning library TensorFlow? Follow this beautiful Medium article(https://medium.com/@d3lm/understand-tensorflow-by-mimicking-its-api-from-scratch-faa55787170d) or alternatively you can watch the 7th lecture of CS224n by Stanford on Youtube for further diving into the details.





VISUALIZATION TOOLS-



NLP-
1)CS224n Winter 2017-Stanford Course taught by Chris Manning & Richard Socher.Get all the solved assignments,Lecture notes and other stuff here(https://github.com/maxim5/cs224n-winter-2017)
2)Implementation of various tasks using NLTK- Sentdex's NLTK playlist
3)





COMPUTER VISION-
1)Follow CS231n by Stanford on Youtube about deep learning with computer vision
2)
3)Best source for project Ideas- http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2017/reports.html




CNNs





RNNs & LSTMs







GANs-1)First take a look at all the astonishing things GANs can do and gain some motivation as to why you should learn them, here(https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/gan-some-cool-applications-of-gans-4c9ecca35900) 



ENSEMBLE MODELS-Even though I should have included this under the ML section itself, but ensemble models are not enough emphasised upon by Blogs and books much.
1)This is a great video from NPTEL(https://nptel.ac.in/courses/128106002/42)  
2)A beautiful kernel on stacked regressions on Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/serigne/stacked-regressions-top-4-on-leaderboard/data)









R Programming-



SQL-I prefer the combination of W3school and SQLfiddle for concept building and practice but you can do both on Kaggle-Learn(If you're too lazy to switch back and forth between 2 tabs!) without any hesitation.



Dashboarding-Want to make cool dashboards to make your visualisations look better? head to Kaggle(Yes,Again!) and follow Rachael Tatman's awesome dashboarding tutorial(https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/dashboarding-with-notebooks-day-1)



Apache Spark-



DATASETS-ohh yes! there is no ML without Datasets.Here's a comprehensive list of sources to get datasets from-
1)Kaggle-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
2)MNIST Datasets
3)Yelp Datasets
